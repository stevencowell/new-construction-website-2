    <h2>2.1 What Are Hazardous Materials?</h2>
    <p>"Hazardous materials" (often called hazardous substances or dangerous goods) are chemicals or materials that can cause harm to people or the environment due to their properties. This includes anything toxic, flammable, corrosive, explosive, or otherwise dangerous. In construction, common hazardous materials include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Asbestos</strong>: A notorious hazardous material once used widely in building products (until the 1980s). It's a mineral fibre that, when disturbed, releases microscopic fibres that can cause serious lung diseases. Asbestos-containing materials (ACM) were used in things like old roofing sheets, wall and ceiling panels, pipe lagging (insulation on pipes), vinyl floor tiles, cement sheeting, etc. ACM stands for "Asbestos Containing Material". If you work in renovation or demolition of older structures, assume materials might contain asbestos unless proven otherwise. Never cut, sand, drill, or break ACM - it's deadly dangerous if fibres are released. We'll cover safe procedures below.</li>
      <li><strong>Silica Dust</strong>: Crystalline silica is found in materials like concrete, bricks, tiles, and sandstone. Cutting, grinding, or jackhammering these can produce fine dust (respirable crystalline silica) that can cause lung damage (silicosis). It's a major hazard that must be controlled with dust suppression (water or vacuum) and respiratory protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Chemical Products</strong>: e.g. Paints, solvents, sealants, adhesives, fuels (petrol, diesel), oils, acids, cleaning products, pesticides. These might be flammable (petrol, thinners), toxic (some solvents, epoxy resins), or corrosive (acids). Improper handling can result in fires, poisoning, burns, or environmental harm. For example, petrol is highly flammable and its vapors are hazardous - it must be stored in proper fuel containers away from ignition sources.</li>
      <li><strong>Cement and Concrete Dust</strong>: Wet cement is caustic (alkaline) and can cause skin burns on prolonged contact; dry cement or concrete dust can irritate eyes and lungs. Always wear gloves, dust masks or respirators, and goggles when working with fresh or dry cement. After use, wash skin to remove any cement.</li>
      <li><strong>Treated Timber</strong>: Timber treated with preservatives like pentachlorophenol or creosote can have toxic chemicals. Cuttings, sawdust, or shavings can be harmful to breathe or touch. Handle treated timber with care, minimize dust, and dispose of waste as per local guidelines (often as hazardous waste).</li>
      <li><strong>Identifying Hazardous Materials</strong>: They often come with labels and Safety Data Sheets:</li>
      <li><strong>Labels and Signs</strong>: Hazardous chemicals should have warning labels (e.g. with hazard symbols) and containers should be clearly marked. You may also see warning signs at the entrance of areas where they are stored (with symbol + brief name of material, country of building, material type) and testing by specialists.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety Data Sheets (SDS)</strong>: Formerly called Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), an SDS provides detailed information about a hazardous substance, including its properties, risks, safe handling, and first aid measures. The SDS accompanies chemicals for workers. (In the assessment, if asked "Where would you find information on how to use and store a hazardous substance?" the answer is: the Safety Data Sheet (SDS).)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.2 Asbestos - Handle with Extreme Care</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What to do if you suspect asbestos</strong>: If you see building materials that look like old asbestos products (e.g. corrugated roofing, flat wall sheeting, vinyl tiles, etc.), stop work and mark the area. Do not touch or disturb the material. Report it immediately to your supervisor. Until it's assessed, assume it's asbestos.</li>
      <li><strong>Do not handle asbestos</strong>: Under regulations, very few people are allowed to remove asbestos. You must never attempt any removal (except for small-scale removals that are strictly defined and allow incidental contact). Don't use power tools on asbestos or remove more than a small patch with hand tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Never use certain equipment on asbestos</strong>: Never dry-sand, saw, or use abrasive tools on asbestos material. These are strictly prohibited - think of anything that creates dust or debris. Instead, use hand tools gently if absolutely needed, or wet methods (wetting asbestos sheet to keep fibres down) and always wear appropriate respirator.</li>
      <li><strong>If it's safe to remove small bits, use control measures</strong>: For very small work (removing <10 square metres), you must still follow rules: wet the asbestos before handling, wrap it in sealed heavy-duty plastic, and label it "Asbestos waste". Clean up all debris carefully. Always use full PPE (gloves, respirator, disposable overalls) and decontaminate tools and yourself after.</li>
      <li><strong>Training and certification</strong>: Anyone doing asbestos removal must be licensed or trained, even for small removals. Untrained workers must not touch asbestos. Employers must provide training on asbestos awareness. If you disturb asbestos by accident, follow emergency procedures: stop, leave area, wash up, and report it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Essential Safety Equipment for Hazardous Materials</h3>
    <p>When working with hazardous materials, proper PPE is essential for protection:</p>
    
    <h4>Respiratory Protection</h4>
    <p><strong>Respirator</strong><br>
    Essential protection against asbestos fibres, silica dust, and other airborne hazards. Must be properly fitted and maintained for maximum protection.</p>

    <h4>Hand Protection</h4>
    <p><strong>Work Gloves</strong><br>
    Protects hands from chemical burns, cuts, and abrasions when handling hazardous materials like cement, treated timber, or chemicals.</p>
    <img src="../Task 1 Modules/images/Work gloves.jpeg" alt="Work gloves - essential protection when handling hazardous materials" style="max-width: 150px; max-height: 150px; width: auto; height: auto; margin: 1rem auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;" />

    <h4>Head Protection</h4>
    <p><strong>Hard Hat</strong><br>
    Protects against falling objects and impacts, especially important when working in areas where hazardous materials may be present.</p>

    <h4>Foot Protection</h4>
    <p><strong>Safety Boots</strong><br>
    Steel-capped boots provide protection against falling objects and chemical spills. Essential when working with hazardous materials.</p>

    <h2>2.3 Other Common Hazards (Mechanical, Electrical, Environmental)</h2>
    <p>Aside from chemicals, construction sites have other hazards:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Working at Heights</strong>: Any time you work above the ground (on ladders, scaffolds, roofs), there's a fall risk. Control measures include using scaffolding with guardrails, personal fall-arrest harnesses, and safe ladders. Always maintain three points of contact on ladders, don't use ladders on uneven ground, and don't overreach.</li>
      <li><strong>Machinery and Tools</strong>: Moving parts on machines (saws, mixers, lifts) can cut or crush. Always use guards and lockout/tagout procedures before maintenance. Check tools before use: broken cords, loose blades, or missing guards mean don't use them until fixed. Trained operators only for equipment like forklifts or power saws.</li>
      <li><strong>Electrical Hazards</strong>: Live wires, damaged cords, and wet conditions can cause shocks or electrocution. Ensure all power tools and extensions are tested and tagged, keep cables off walkways, and use RCDs (safety switches). Turn off power before working on circuits, and only authorized personnel should deal with electrical fittings.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Conditions</strong>: Weather (heat, cold, wind, storms) and terrain (uneven ground, noise, dust) can cause injuries. Wear appropriate clothing (sun protection, warm gear), stay hydrated, and take breaks in shade or shelter. Control dust with water suppression and wear masks if needed. Wear hearing protection in very noisy areas and ensure visibility (hi-vis vests) if busy.</li>
