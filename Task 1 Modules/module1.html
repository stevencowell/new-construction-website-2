    <h2>WHS Legislative Framework</h2>
    <p>The safety laws in Australia are designed to protect everyone at a workplace. The primary law is the <strong>Work Health and Safety (WHS) Act 2011</strong>. This Act sets out the broad responsibilities for safety.</p>
    <p>Supporting the Act are the <strong>WHS Regulations 2017</strong>, which detail the specific requirements for particular hazards and work practices (e.g., how to manage risks from falls, electricity, or machinery).</p>
    <p>Finally, there are <strong>Codes of Practice</strong>, which provide practical, step-by-step guidance on how to comply with the Act and Regulations.</p>
    
    <!-- Note on regulatory changes: In 2025 SafeWork NSW was established as a standalone regulator. -->
    <p><em>Note:</em> In 2025, SafeWork NSW became an independent statutory authority under the <strong>Work Health and Safety (Standalone Regulator) Act 2025</strong>.  This change separated the regulator from the Department of Customer Service and established a new SafeWork Commissioner and advisory council.  While the WHS Act 2011 and Regulations 2017 continue to apply, you should be aware of this change when referring to current legislation and guidance.</p>
    <h2>Duty of Care</h2>
    <p>Duty of Care is a central principle of WHS law. It means that everyone at the workplace has a legal responsibility to ensure their actions don't cause harm to others. This is a shared responsibility.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PCBU (Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking):</strong> This is the employer or company. Their primary duty of care is to provide a safe working environment. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Providing and maintaining safe machinery and equipment.</li>
                <li>Ensuring safe systems of work are in place.</li>
                <li>Providing necessary information, training, instruction, and supervision.</li>
                <li>Ensuring the safe use, handling, and storage of substances.</li>
                <li>Providing adequate facilities for the welfare of workers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Workers (You):</strong> As a worker, your duty of care is to:
            <ul>
                <li>Take reasonable care for your own health and safety.</li>
                <li>Take reasonable care that your actions (or omissions) do not adversely affect the health and safety of other people.</li>
                <li>Comply with any reasonable instruction that is given by the PCBU.</li>
                <li>Cooperate with any reasonable policy or procedure relating to WHS at the workplace.</li>
                <!-- Additional obligations drawn from SafeWork NSW worker responsibilities: use PPE, report hazards and participate in consultation -->
                <li>Use and wear all personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety equipment provided by your PCBU as instructed.</li>
                <li>Report hazards, incidents, near misses or injuries promptly so that appropriate action can be taken.</li>
                <li>Participate in training, consultation and supervision to improve safety on site.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h2>
    <p>Personal Protective Equipment is essential for protecting workers from workplace hazards. The following PPE items are commonly required on construction sites:</p>
    
    <h3>Head Protection</h3>
    <p><strong>Hard Hat</strong><br>
    Protects against falling objects, impacts, and electrical hazards. Must be worn at all times on construction sites. Ensure proper fit and replace if damaged.</p>

    <h3>Hand Protection</h3>
    <p><strong>Work Gloves</strong><br>
    Protects hands from cuts, abrasions, chemicals, and other hazards. Choose the right type for the specific task and material being handled.</p>

    <h3>Eye Protection</h3>
    <p><strong>Safety Glasses</strong><br>
    Safety glasses or goggles protect against flying particles, dust, and chemical splashes. They should fit snugly and be kept clean for maximum protection.</p>
