[
{
"title":"Topic 1: Preparing a Materials List",
"theory":[
"A materials list is a detailed record of all the timber and materials you will need for a construction project. Preparing an accurate materials list involves carefully reading project plans, identifying components, measuring accurately, calculating totals, and clearly recording the material type and quantity required. Mistakes can lead to material shortages, increased costs, and project delays."
],
"qs":[
{"q":"Scenario 1:\nYour group needs timber for 10 identical wall studs, each measuring 2400 mm. How much total timber length is required?","a":"24,000 mm or 24 metres."},
{"q":"Scenario 2:\nYou've calculated timber lengths without considering standard timber sizes available at your local supplier. What should you do next?","a":"Adjust your lengths to match supplier sizes to reduce waste and cost."}
]
},
{
"title":"Topic 2: Writing a Construction Procedure",
"theory":[
"A construction procedure outlines the exact steps needed to manufacture and assemble project components. It lists clearly defined tasks, responsibilities, tools, checking methods, and required PPE. Good construction procedures improve safety, efficiency, and quality, ensuring everyone on the team clearly understands their roles."
],
"qs":[
{"q":"Scenario 1:\nYour teammate is unsure how to record responsibility clearly on the construction procedure. What advice do you provide?","a":"Clearly list each task against one team member’s name, ensuring each person understands their specific duties."},
{"q":"Scenario 2:\nYou notice a task listed without a checking method. Why is this a problem?","a":"Tasks must have checks to ensure accuracy and quality; without checks, mistakes can occur unnoticed."}
]
},
{
"title":"Topic 3: Completing a Job Safety Analysis (JSA)",
"theory":[
"A JSA identifies potential hazards associated with each work activity, assesses risks before and after controls are applied, and clearly assigns responsibilities. Completing a JSA helps reduce accidents by anticipating hazards and providing clear actions to manage risks."
],
"qs":[
{"q":"Scenario 1:\nYour JSA identifies a hazard as \"sharp timber edges\". What is an effective hazard control?","a":"Wear gloves when handling, or sand timber edges to reduce sharpness."},
{"q":"Scenario 2:\nThe JSA pre-risk is \"3\" but after control measures, the risk remains \"3\". What does this indicate?","a":"The hazard control isn't effective; additional or alternative controls are required to lower the risk."}
]
},
{
"title":"Topic 4: Skills Evaluation and Plan",
"theory":[
"Evaluating your construction skills honestly helps you identify strengths and weaknesses. Creating a skills-development plan based on this evaluation is essential for career progression, ensuring you address skill gaps and become a competent tradesperson."
],
"qs":[
{"q":"Scenario 1:\nYour skills evaluation reveals you lack confidence in reading construction plans. Suggest a practical next step.","a":"Practise reading plans regularly, seek guidance from teachers or experienced tradespeople, and possibly undertake additional targeted training."},
{"q":"Scenario 2:\nYou rated \"weak\" in handling carpentry materials. What are two practical ways to improve this skill?","a":"Participate in hands-on practice sessions and seek additional work placements or volunteering opportunities on-site."}
]
},
{
"title":"Topic 5: Environmental Incident Reporting",
"theory":[
"Environmental incident reporting captures and documents situations where site activities negatively impact the environment. Accurate reporting helps companies manage environmental responsibilities and demonstrates a proactive approach to environmental protection, complying with legal and ethical standards."
],
"qs":[
{"q":"Scenario 1:\nYou witness a team member spilling paint near a stormwater drain. What immediate actions do you take?","a":"Contain the spill immediately, report it to a supervisor, and assist with cleanup measures as instructed."},
{"q":"Scenario 2:\nYou fill out an Environmental Incident Report. Why is suggesting future controls essential?","a":"It helps prevent future incidents by recommending training, procedure changes, or equipment adjustments."}
]
},
{
"title":"Additional Check-in Questions (General Preparation)",
"theory":[],
"qs":[
{"q":"Scenario:\nWhen filling out the materials list, why is it crucial to double-check total lengths?","a":"Prevents shortages, reduces waste, and ensures accurate material ordering."},
{"q":"Scenario:\nYour construction procedure missed mentioning PPE for cutting tasks. What's the likely consequence?","a":"Increased risk of injury and non-compliance with WHS regulations."},
{"q":"Scenario:\nYou overlooked a major hazard during JSA. How might this affect your team during project execution?","a":"It significantly increases risk, potentially leading to accidents or injuries."},
{"q":"Scenario:\nYou haven't created a skills-development plan after evaluation. Why might this impact your future in construction?","a":"Without a plan, skill gaps may remain unaddressed, hindering your progress and job opportunities."},
{"q":"Scenario:\nYou ignored reporting an environmental incident. How does this affect the workplace?","a":"Risks regulatory penalties, damages company reputation, and negatively impacts the environment."}
]
},
{
"title":"Stretch/Reflection Questions (Optional for deeper thinking)",
"theory":[],
"qs":[
{"q":"Reflection 1:\nHow can teamwork during materials calculation and construction procedure preparation improve your understanding of construction processes?","a":"(reflect and answer individually)"},
{"q":"Reflection 2:\nReflect on how regular JSA completion can change the safety culture of a workplace.","a":"(reflect and answer individually)"},
{"q":"Reflection 3:\nWhy is continuous skills evaluation critical in an ever-changing construction industry?","a":"(reflect and answer individually)"},
{"q":"Reflection 4:\nHow does environmental awareness on construction sites benefit not just the environment but the construction company and its workers?","a":"(reflect and answer individually)"}
