"title":"Topic 1 – Construction Codes, Standards & Policies",
"scenario":"Council inspections are tomorrow, and your supervisor asks you to confirm if the newly framed wall complies with timber standards. Which document do you reference, and why?",
"teach":[
 "In the construction industry, three key types of documentation guide the quality, legality, and safety of every project:",
 "• The National Construction Code (NCC) sets minimum national standards, ensuring all Australian buildings meet baseline safety and performance.",
 "• Australian Standards (AS) provide detailed technical rules. For example, AS 1684 specifies timber framing dimensions, which are essential when planning structural elements.",
 "• Workplace Quality Policies are internal documents created by individual companies. These policies detail company-specific quality checks, ensuring all work meets the NCC and relevant Standards.",
 "Knowing which document applies in specific situations helps maintain compliance, safety, and efficiency on-site."
],
"method":[
 "Use Australian Standards, specifically AS 1684, because it provides detailed timber-framing requirements for compliance."
],
"tip":"If tolerances aren’t on the drawings, check the workplace quality policy—company documents often hold exact workmanship limits.",
"qs":[
 {"q":"Scenario: You notice minor wall-frame tolerances aren't clearly listed on site plans. Where would you find these detailed quality standards?","a":"Workplace quality policies, as they detail exact workmanship tolerances tailored to your company's standards."},
 {"q":"Scenario: A colleague asks why they can’t ignore a particular Australian Standard not mentioned directly in the drawings. What is your advice?","a":"If referenced by the NCC, the Standard becomes mandatory, and ignoring it would breach compliance and risk liability."}
]
},

{
"title":"Topic 2 – Tool Identification & Safe Usage",
"scenario":"You need to quickly secure plywood sheets onto framing, and power is unavailable. What's your best tool choice?",
"teach":[
 "Correct tool selection and safe usage are fundamental skills on a construction site. Tools such as hammers, drills, saws, nail guns, and generators have distinct purposes and associated hazards.",
 "Understanding the appropriate tool for each job ensures tasks are completed safely, efficiently, and effectively, reducing the risk of injury or rework."
],
"method":[
 "Use a cordless drill, as it provides portability and efficiency without mains power."
],
"tip":"Never substitute fastening tools for cutting tools—each is designed for a specific purpose and safety profile.",
"qs":[
 {"q":"Scenario: A colleague tries to trim decking boards with a jigsaw. Explain why this is inappropriate.","a":"Jigsaw are not for straight accurate cuts; a circular saw is appropriate for precise cutting tasks."},
 {"q":"Scenario: Your generator emits smoke shortly after starting. What's your immediate action?","a":"Shut it down immediately, isolate it, and report the fault for repair—using it poses serious safety risks."}
]
},

{
"title":"Topic 3 – Interpreting Construction Drawings & Plans",
"scenario":"You need to check if a pergola complies with the setback distances from the boundary. Which drawing should you consult first?",
"teach":[
 "Accurate interpretation of various construction drawings—such as site plans, floor plans, elevations, and detail drawings—is crucial.",
 "Each plan provides specific information necessary for construction, from boundary setbacks and heights to detailed joinery components."
],
"method":[
 "Consult the site plan, as it shows precise boundary measurements and setbacks."
],
"tip":"Elevation drawings reveal heights; detail drawings zoom in for precise component clarity.",
"qs":[
 {"q":"Scenario: Your team needs the exact height of a new window installation. Where do you look?","a":"Elevation drawings, as these show vertical dimensions and heights."},
 {"q":"Scenario: A detailed lintel joint is unclear on the main drawings. Which document provides clarity?","a":"Detail drawings, as they zoom in on specific complex construction elements with precise measurements."}
]
},

{
"title":"Topic 4 – Specifications & Their Contents",
"scenario":"You can't find the paint finish details on any drawings. Where should you look?",
"teach":[
 "Specifications accompany drawings, offering additional detailed instructions. They cover workmanship quality, materials, tolerances, finishes, and fixture specifics.",
 "Specifications ensure clarity about project expectations, preventing miscommunication and errors."
],
"method":[
 "Look in the project specifications, as they detail exact finishes and coatings."
],
"tip":"When drawings and specs conflict, specs usually take precedence on workmanship details.",
"qs":[
 {"q":"Scenario: Your apprentice asks why you’re checking tolerances from the specification instead of the drawings. How do you explain?","a":"Specifications provide detailed tolerances and are authoritative over drawings if discrepancies arise."}
]
},

{
"title":"Topic 5 – Levels, Plumb & Measuring Tools",
"scenario":"Which tool would you use to ensure long horizontal members are perfectly level over a 10-metre span?",
"teach":[
 "Builders rely on precise terms—level (horizontal), plumb (vertical), and line (straight alignment)—and accurate tools to ensure structural integrity.",
 "Correct measurement prevents structural failure and ensures compliance with design plans."
],
"method":[
 "Use a laser level or water level, suitable for accuracy over long distances."
],
"tip":"For quick vertical checks, spirit levels or plumb bobs remain reliable staples.",
"qs":[
 {"q":"Scenario: How would you quickly check if a wall frame is vertically straight?","a":"Use a spirit level or plumb bob, as both tools effectively confirm vertical alignment."}
]
},

{
"title":"Topic 6 – Essential Construction Skills & Teamwork",
"scenario":"A team member struggles to understand the day's tasks, causing delays. What's your best action?",
"teach":[
 "Effective teamwork, clear communication, planning, problem-solving, and WHS awareness are core skills required in construction.",
 "These skills ensure that work is completed safely, efficiently, and to a high standard."
],
"method":[
 "Clearly communicate tasks again, encourage questions, and confirm understanding to avoid further delays."
